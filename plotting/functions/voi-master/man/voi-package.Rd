\title{Methods to calculate the Expected Value of Information}
\description{
\code{\link{evppi}} calculates the expected value of partial perfect information from a decision-analytic model.  The default, recommended computation methods are based on nonparametric regression.  \code{\link{evpi}} is also provided for the expected value of perfect information.

\code{\link{evsi}} calculates the expected value of sample information.   Currently this implements the same set of nonparametric regression methods as in \code{\link{evppi}}, and methods based on moment matching and importance sampling.  \code{\link{enbs}} can then be used to calculate and optimise the expected net benefit of sampling for a simple study with a fixed upfront cost and per-participant costs.

\code{\link{evppi}} and \code{\link{evsi}} both require a sample of inputs and outputs from a Monte Carlo probabilistic analysis of a decision-analytic model.

Analogous functions \code{\link{evppivar}} and \code{\link{evsivar}} calculate the EVPPI and EVSI for models used for estimation rather than decision-making.   The value of information is measured by expected reductions in variance of an uncertain model output of interest.

A pure "brute-force" Monte Carlo method for EVPPI calculation is provided in \code{\link{evppi_mc}}, though this is usually computationally impractical.

The \href{https://chjackson.github.io/voi/articles/voi.html}{package overview / Get Started vignette} gives worked examples of the use of all of these functions.
