% roi is 16,44:1 according to cdc
% can we release earlier than the end of the vaccine rollout?
% update country contact rates
% d=1 at the end for vaccine uptake: maybe release slowly over time
% five year period
% much higher oc death rate - see squire lmics website

New P2 Measure: PPE
FOI for healthcare workers depends on H, but with scaling factor dh
lower bound: dh=baseline, upper bound: dh=0
ifr depends on proportion of healthcare workers available
how does this interact with contact matrices though?

%change p3 p4 to linearly scaling with prevalence
%same for overcapacity death rate

% PARAMETERS:
%   Covid immune period longer now?
%   country-specific disease parameters
%
% DATA:
%   xmin for different countries
%   make xmin compatible
%   update wfh values for all countries
%
% ENDING: 
%   d=1%???
%   switching with social distancing: 3-4
%   different thresholds?
%   shading different
%
% HOSPITAL CAPACITY REFOMRULATION:
%   fixed number threshold
%   over-capacity death rate
%
% PREPAREDNESS:
%   legal frameworks will affect speed of response too
%   gio paper on behavioural changes due to covid: delta between countries
%   delta out of lockdown  vs. uptake
%   vax. admin and speed up
%    
% COSTING:
%   gio paper on probability of pandemic, also cgdev statistic
%   gdp loss per 5 years
%   marginals
%   roi
%
% PLOTTING:
%   standardise colour axis    
%
% CONCLUSIONS:
%   disease-independent P2 measures: hospital capacity
