* partial argument matching in https://github.com/chjackson/voi/blob/master/R/evppi_gam.R#L11.  nicer to make inla and gp methods return classed model object and use fitted() method. 


## TODO long term 

* More built-in common study designs for EVSI, e.g. binary trial that just informs the odds ratio.

* Different regression methods and options for effects and costs (e.g. int.ord)


## Features that I don't plan to implement myself, but would accept cleanly-written contributions for (see coding_style.md) 

* Parallel processing for 2 level Monte Carlo, and partial results for convergence checking 

* Gaussian Approximation EVSI method

* MLMC and QMC methods

* 2-level Monte Carlo EVSI

* Check can reproduce results from ConVoI 1 four case studies

* Standard errors for EVSI methods and INLA EVPPI method
